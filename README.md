Hello, welcome to my project Play Drums (v1.0)!

There's a project focused on javascript studies. It consists in a drum that you can play in two different ways:

1. You can be a freestyle player and press the keys to make a song by your own rhythm.

2. If you're not a good musician (I'm right here), you can use the input down below to write a sequence and the website will play for you. Every ' ' is 
a 250ms rhythm pause added to your composition and while using the input, every key has 250ms of timeout to play the next one. 

There's a screenshot of the app visuals on the file so you can take a sneaky peak before download.

Hope you like =)
